# Hospital-Emergency-Room-Patient-Status

I recently designed an interactive dashboard that provides deep insights into hospital emergency room operations. This project helped me sharpen my data analysis and visualization skills while working with real-world healthcare data. 
Key insights from the dashboard:
ğŸ“Œ Patient Admission Status â€“ Number of patients admitted vs. not admitted
ğŸ“Œ Age Distribution â€“ Grouping patients by age
ğŸ“Œ Timeliness â€“ Percentage of patients seen within 30 minutes
ğŸ“Œ Gender Analysis â€“ Number of male vs. female patients
ğŸ“Œ Department Referrals â€“ Most referred hospital departments
Through this project, I learned how to structure healthcare data, apply analytical techniques, and present findings in an engaging and intuitive format.
